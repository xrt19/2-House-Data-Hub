In my algorithm and programming course, I was assigned a project on learning (AoL) to create a program that describes the frequency of each unique item, such as type and furnish. The program also needed to be able to search for data based on user prompts and handle lists of strings. The assignment covered fundamental programming concepts, including sorting and searching algorithms.
